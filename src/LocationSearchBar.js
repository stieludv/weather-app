// location search bar to change location of weatherData



// add event listener to data attribute weather-search-bar

// on change maybe check if possible that its a correct city?
// should I have dropdowns to select country and then city?
// should it just be text input search?

// on button press 
// update displayController
// when displayController gets data from weatherData 
// weatherData will use memo function which makes sure the current data is available
// without unnecessary api calls


// I need to use maybe one api to first verify a location
// I then need to attempt weatherapi api with location to make sure they have the same location
// Otherwise I will need to provide adequate error messages along the way so uesr
// can adjust their input
